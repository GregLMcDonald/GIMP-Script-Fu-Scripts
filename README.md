# GIMP-Script-Fu-Scripts
Script-Fu scripts mostly for automated scaling and name of image files for app development

Corona SDK builds for iOS and Android require a large set of icon images at different sizes.  The make-corona-icons script
builds these starting from a 180x180 flat image.  The filename required by Corona is given to each file and they are 
exported at PNG images into a directory specified **in the script**.

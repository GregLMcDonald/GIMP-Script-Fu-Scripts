README make-corona-icons

This is a GIMP script that generates all the icon PNG files needed for iOS and Android build
in Corona SDK.  On my installation, I drop it in:

		~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.8/scripts	

The script-fu-menu-register command at the end adds it to the ScriptFu menu in the menu bar.


This script is provided as is without warranty.  It works on my OSX installation, but I'm sure 
any number of things can break it.

Assert:
	/Users/greg/Desktop/CoronaIcons exists and is writable (you can change this in the script!)
	- active image is 180 x 180
